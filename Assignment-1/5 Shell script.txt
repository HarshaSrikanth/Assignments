Shell Scripting:
 Shell scripting is nothing but a list of commands in a computer program.that list of commands were run by the Unix shell interpreter
Many operations are performed by shell scripts like program execution, file manipulation and text printing.
There are two types of shell:
1.C Shell
2.Bourne Shell

Program for hello world:
#! /bin/bash
#this is first program
echo "hello world"

Program for variable:
#! /bin/bash
#this is user defined variable
name="harsha"
echo "this is my name $name"
echo -n "enter you name : "
read name1
echo "this is name given by console,name is $name1"

#! /bin/bash
#this is my prog for variable numerical
echo "enter your 1st number"
read a
echo "enter your 2nd number"
read b
c=`expr $a + $b`
echo "sum is: $c"

Program for operators:
#! /bin/bash
#this program is for operators
a=10
b=20
sum=`expr $a + $b`
sub=`expr $a - $b`
mul=`expr $a \* $b`
div=`expr $a / $b`
mod=`expr $a % $b`
echo "sum:$sum"
echo "sub:$sub"
echo "mul:$mul"
echo "div:$div"
echo "mod:$mod"

Program for control statements:
#! /bin/bash
#to check even or odd
a=15
if [ `expr $a % 2` -eq 0  ]
then
        echo "even"
else
        echo "odd"
fi

Program for functions:
function addition(){
  echo `expr $1 + $2`
}
addition 34 45
