Waterfall Model:
  Waterfall model is one of the linear software development approach.In this approach every phase is different
these phases are followed by designing,coding,testing and deployment.In this waterfall model,we cannot make
changes easily.we face forward conflicts and there is no software to optimise the process.This approach is good

Agile Methodology:
  Agile methodology is an iterative approach and also a continous integration and continous deployment approach.
Each iteration takes a short interval of 1-4 weeks.It is team based and includes every member of team.This approach 
mainly contains scrum master,scrum team,product owner,sprints,sprint planning,sprint retrospection.In this agile,there
will stand up/sync up meeting every day to analyse the progress of project.This approach is better than waterfall model.

Dev-Ops:
Dev-Ops is a combination of development and operational team.In this approach ,there will be continous development,
continous integration,continous testing,continous deployment.This is the best approach compared to all.
